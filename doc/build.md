# Building MultICE
MultICE uses a relatively simple build system. It has been tested on Arch Linux, Debian Linux, OpenOS and Plan9k.
## 1. Choose modules.
The system is made out of modules from the `modules/` directory. When you run the build script, it assembles them, and optionally optimises the code for space.  
There are a number of preconfigured module sets in the `config/` directory, and you can of course you can write your own.

The build system defaults to a file called `modules.cfg` in the current directory. You can specify a config file using `--modconfig=file.cfg`.
## 2. Configure build system
The build system has a configuration file `build.cfg`, though another can be specified using `--cfgfile=file.cfg`.
### `optimise`
Can either be yes or no.  
Specifies whether to run the simple optimisation function on the kernel.
### `test`
Can either be yes or no.  
Specifies whether to test the final kernel (using load). Only picks up syntax errors.
### `log`
Can either be yes or no.  
Specifies whether to output log files.
### `opath`
Specifies where to put the output kernel.
### `ospath`
Specifies where to put the output kernel after being optimised.

## 3. Build.
Simply run `build.lua`. Under OpenOS or plan9k that may just be going to the right dir and entering `build`, but under proper UNIX systems it may involve `lua build.lua`.
